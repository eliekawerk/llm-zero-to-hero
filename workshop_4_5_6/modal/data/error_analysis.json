This might involve better prompt engineering to specifically request only information directly stated in the source, retraining the LLM on a dataset emphasizing factual accuracy and source fidelity, or using a different LLM altogether which exhibits better performance on factual tasks.  Furthermore, implement stronger verification steps before presenting information as fact. For example, the system could check if information is directly supported by the retrieved source documents.  Add a confidence score to the output, allowing for filtering of low-confidence predictions.",

      "reasoning": "The predicted answer mentions technology and platform development, which is partially correct as the gold standard mentions the technology industry. However, it also introduces irrelevant information about volunteer work mentoring aspiring platform developers and omits crucial information about the specific companies where the candidate worked (Tech Solutions Inc. and Innovative Platforms Ltd.).  The inclusion of incorrect information and omission of key details significantly reduces the accuracy."

This may involve refining the query, adjusting the retrieval parameters (e.g., increasing the number of top retrieved documents, adjusting similarity thresholds), or using more sophisticated retrieval techniques such as dense passage retrieval.  Additionally, checking for and handling potential formatting issues within the resume (e.g., inconsistent capitalization, unusual spacing) could also help improve the completeness of the extraction.",

While the predicted answer correctly identifies Python, Java, Javascript, and TypeScript, it omits several key languages including HTML5, CSS3, Sass, SQL, and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL). The omission of these languages significantly reduces the overall correctness of the prediction.

Instead of extracting a precise number, it should aim to extract and summarize the relevant information in its original form (e.g., \"Over 7 years\"). This might involve enhancing the model's ability to recognize and process ranges or qualitative descriptions of experience rather than strictly numerical data.  Additionally, improving the model's ability to handle ambiguous or vague information regarding professional experience would help avoid such errors.  More robust fact-checking mechanisms that cross-reference numerical data with contextual cues could also be beneficial.",

While it correctly identifies the candidate's Bachelor of Science degree, it omits crucial details such as the university's full name, graduation date, and other relevant certifications (Udacity Nanodegree and freeCodeCamp certification).  Therefore, a significant amount of information is missing. The prediction's correctness is approximately 25% because it only covers one of the four key pieces of information. "
