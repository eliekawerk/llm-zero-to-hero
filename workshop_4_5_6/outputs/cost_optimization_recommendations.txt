Token Efficiency Improvements:
- Overall token efficiency is low (0.0000 accuracy per 1K tokens)
  Consider optimizing prompts to reduce token usage while maintaining accuracy
- Most token-efficient question: 'Does the candidate have experience working with cloud technologies?'
  Efficiency: 0.0000 accuracy per 1K tokens
- Least token-efficient question: 'Does the candidate have experience working with cloud technologies?'
  Efficiency: 0.0000 accuracy per 1K tokens
  Consider revising the retrieval or prompt approach for this question type

Cost Optimization Strategies:
- Most expensive question type: 'Does the candidate have experience working with cloud technologies?'
  Average cost: $0.0000 per query

Performance Optimization Opportunities:
- Focus on improving: 'What is the total number of years of professional experience?'
  Current accuracy: 16.67%

Potential Impact:
- Current cost per correct answer: $0.0000
- By improving accuracy to 90.00%, cost could reduce to $0.0000 per correct answer
- Potential savings: $0.0000 per correct answer (nan% reduction)
