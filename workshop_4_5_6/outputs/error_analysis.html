                <h3>Question: Does the candidate have any leadership or management experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> emma-roberts.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Not mentioned in the resume.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Based on the provided resume, Emma Roberts has mentored aspiring platform developers as a Tech Mentor at Code5Good, implying some leadership experience.  However, there is no explicit mention of management responsibilities in her roles.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model hallucinated leadership experience.  The gold standard answer explicitly states that leadership experience is not mentioned in the resume. The model's claim that Emma Roberts mentored aspiring developers implies leadership is a fabrication, as this detail is not supported by the provided context (resume).</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to distinguish between implicit and explicit information.  Implement stronger fact-checking mechanisms to verify the model's claims against the source document.  Retrain the model on examples that emphasize the importance of precise and accurate information retrieval, and penalize hallucinated information.</p>

                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> emma-roberts.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Over 1.5 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 1.5 years</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model's response, "1.5 years", is technically incorrect because the gold standard answer specifies "Over 1.5 years".  While the numerical part is close, the response lacks the crucial qualifier "Over", thus misrepresenting the actual experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to identify and incorporate qualifying phrases like "over", "under", "approximately", etc. This could involve more robust training data encompassing various numerical qualifiers and improved prompt engineering to elicit precise information extraction.</p>

                <h3>Question: What industries has the candidate worked in?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> emma-roberts.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the technology industry, specifically at Tech Solutions Inc. and Innovative Platforms Ltd.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the following industries: Services (Google Cloud), Tech Solutions, and Innovative Platforms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The prediction incorrectly categorized Google Cloud as part of the 'Services' industry.  While Google Cloud is a service, it's more accurately classified under the technology industry, aligning with the candidate's other experiences at Tech Solutions and Innovative Platforms. The core information is present but miscategorized, leading to a slightly inaccurate industry representation.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to classify industries more accurately.  This might involve training it on a richer dataset of industry classifications or incorporating a more sophisticated industry ontology during the response generation phase.  Additionally, providing more context on what constitutes "technology industry" could assist the LLM.</p>

                <h3>Question: What industries has the candidate worked in?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> jane-smith.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the technology industry, specifically at Tech Innovators Inc., Innovative Solutions Ltd., and Web Solutions Co.  The exact nature of these companies' industries is not specified.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Based on the provided resume, the candidate has worked in the following industries: technology (specifically software development), and potentially e-commerce (given the mention of developing an e-commerce platform).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The prediction introduces an unsupported detail: "specifically software development" and a speculative detail: "and potentially e-commerce (given the mention of developing an e-commerce platform)".  While the resume may mention an e-commerce platform, this doesn't automatically mean the candidate worked in the e-commerce *industry*. The gold standard appropriately reflects the information available - the candidate worked in technology, but the specific sub-industry within technology is not specified.  The addition of "software development" is an unsupported assumption. </p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to avoid making assumptions not explicitly supported by the retrieved context.  The model should be trained to prefer more conservative answers when the information is ambiguous and to clearly indicate when it is inferring or speculating instead of presenting inferences as facts.  Consider adding a prompt that instructs the LLM to only use explicitly mentioned information.</p>

                <h3>Question: List the programming languages mentioned in the resume.</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> john-doe.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, jQuery</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The prediction added frameworks (React, Vue.js, jQuery) to the list of programming languages.  While these frameworks often use the listed languages, they aren't programming languages themselves.  This indicates an issue with correctly distinguishing between programming languages and related technologies.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to differentiate between programming languages and related frameworks or libraries. This could involve fine-tuning the model on a dataset specifically designed to teach it this distinction, or by modifying the prompt to explicitly request only programming languages, and potentially adding examples of what constitutes a programming language vs a framework.</p>

                <h3>Question: What is the total number of years of professional experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> john-doe.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> 2.5 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 1.5 years</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system incorrectly predicted 1.5 years of professional experience when the gold standard answer is 2.5 years.  This is a significant difference, misrepresenting the candidate's experience by a full year.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process by using more robust keyword matching and potentially employing semantic search techniques.  Ensure that all relevant documents containing information about the candidate's experience are included in the retrieval set.  Consider using multiple sources to corroborate experience claims.  Implement more rigorous verification methods within the RAG pipeline to cross-check numerical data against multiple sources.</p>

                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, JSON, XML</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system failed to extract all the programming languages listed in the resume.  It correctly identified Python, Java, Javascript, SQL, and NoSQL but omitted JSON and XML.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process by ensuring the complete resume text is processed and that the extraction logic correctly identifies all mentions of programming languages, perhaps using a more robust named entity recognition model or regular expression tailored to programming language identification.</p>

                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> michael-johnson.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Over 12 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 12</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer is numerically correct but lacks the crucial qualifier "Over".  The gold standard answer emphasizes that the experience exceeds 12 years, while the prediction provides only the numerical value. This omission of the qualifier changes the meaning and is therefore a form of missing information.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to identify and retain crucial qualifiers from retrieved context.  This might involve fine-tuning with examples that highlight the importance of qualifiers, or adjusting the prompt to explicitly request complete and qualified answers.  Furthermore, it's important to ensure the retriever is adequately collecting all relevant sections of text containing qualifying phrases.</p>
