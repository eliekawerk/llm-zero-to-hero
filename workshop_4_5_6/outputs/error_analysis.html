                <h3>Question: What is the total number of years of professional experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> jane-smith.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Over 7 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 7</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model's prediction of "7" is numerically incorrect, as the gold standard answer specifies "Over 7 years".  The model correctly identified a numerical answer relating to years of experience but failed to capture the nuance of "over" 7 years, losing precision.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to handle comparative phrases like "over" and "more than." This could involve incorporating more sophisticated numerical reasoning capabilities and training on datasets with a diverse range of comparative expressions within numerical contexts.  Additionally, training examples should include instances emphasizing the importance of retaining qualifying words in the response.  During post-processing, add a check to see if the response is a number and the gold standard contains qualifiers (e.g., "over", "approximately", "more than", etc.). If so, output a warning indicating potential precision loss.</p>

                <h3>Question: What degrees or academic qualifications does the candidate hold?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> john-doe.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Technology, graduating in May 2022.  They also have a Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity and a JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification from freeCodeCamp.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The candidate holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Technology, graduating in May 2022.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system failed to retrieve and include all relevant information about the candidate's academic qualifications. While it correctly identified the Bachelor of Science degree, it omitted the additional certifications from Udacity and freeCodeCamp. This omission presents an incomplete picture of the candidate's qualifications.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process by ensuring that all relevant sections of the document containing the candidate's qualifications are indexed and retrieved.  Consider techniques like query expansion, reranking retrieved documents based on relevance to the specific question, and implementing more robust search strategies to ensure comprehensive information extraction.</p>

                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> 2.5 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 1.5 years</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system predicted 1.5 years of professional experience when the gold standard answer is 2.5 years. This is a significant numerical discrepancy, misrepresenting the candidate's experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval mechanism to ensure all relevant information is extracted from the source documents.  Consider using more sophisticated embedding models or query strategies to ensure better matching and retrieval of the information related to professional experience. Double-check the data sources for accuracy and completeness.</p>

                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, JSON, XML</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, Node.js</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer omits JSON and XML, which are explicitly mentioned in the gold standard answer.  While Node.js is technically related to JavaScript, it's not a direct equivalent and its inclusion does not compensate for the missing languages.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process to ensure all relevant information is extracted from the resume. This might involve refining the retrieval query, adjusting the ranking algorithm to prioritize more comprehensive matches, or using a more robust embedding model.  A more thorough post-processing check could also identify missing or incomplete lists.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h3>Question: Does the candidate have any leadership or management experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> alex-thompson.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Not mentioned in the resume.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Based on the provided resume, Alex Thompson has some experience that could be considered leadership or management, though not explicitly labeled as such.  In their role as Backend Developer at Tech Innovations Ltd., they collaborated with frontend developers, product managers, and QA engineers to define requirements, establish timelines, and deliver features.  Additionally, they conducted code reviews and provided feedback to ensure code quality.  As a Coding Mentor at Code4Good, they mentored aspiring backend developers, conducted workshops, and assisted in organizing hackathons.  However, the resume doesn't describe formal leadership or management roles with direct reports or budgetary responsibilities.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model incorrectly infers leadership and management experience from collaborative work and mentoring activities. While the description of Alex Thompson's roles mentions collaboration and mentoring, these do not constitute formal leadership or management experience, which typically involves direct reports and/or budgetary responsibilities.  The gold standard answer correctly identifies that the resume lacks mention of such experience. The model's answer is a misinterpretation of the provided context and introduces false information.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to distinguish between collaborative work and formal leadership/management roles.  This could involve fine-tuning the model on a dataset that explicitly contrasts these concepts, or incorporating stricter rules into the response generation process to ensure that claims of leadership/management are only made if explicitly supported by the provided text.  The model should be trained to accurately reflect the absence of information when it is not present in the source document.</p>

                <h3>Question: What is the total number of years of professional experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> michael-johnson.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Over 12 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 17</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model predicted "17" years of experience, while the gold standard answer is "Over 12 years".  This is a significant numerical discrepancy, misrepresenting the candidate's experience level.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to handle nuanced phrasing like "Over 12 years." This might involve training on more diverse examples with similar phrasing, incorporating better numerical reasoning capabilities, or employing techniques to manage uncertainty and provide a range of possible answers instead of a single precise number when appropriate.  Furthermore, ensuring the retrieval system returns relevant and precise information about experience is crucial.  A post-processing step to verify the reasonableness of numerical answers against the source text can also help.</p>

                <h3>Question: List the programming languages mentioned in the resume.</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> JO Reyes CV April 2025.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Python, SQL, TypeScript, .Net Core,  ReactJS,  NextJS,  Java</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Python, TypeScript, .Net Core</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system failed to retrieve and/or process all the programming languages listed in the resume.  The predicted answer is missing SQL, ReactJS, NextJS, and Java, which are all present in the gold standard answer. This omission significantly reduces the completeness and accuracy of the response.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval component of the RAG system. This may involve techniques such as query expansion to enhance recall, optimization of the retrieval model to better match the question with relevant document sections containing programming language information, or using a different retrieval method entirely. Ensure that the entire relevant section of the resume is processed, and consider techniques to handle potential information fragmentation.</p>

                <h3>Question: Has the candidate worked in any Fortune 500 companies?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> JO Reyes CV April 2025.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Not mentioned in the resume.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Based on the provided resume, the candidate has worked at Inchcape Australia, a multinational automotive distribution company.  Whether or not Inchcape is a Fortune 500 company is not specified in the context.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The prediction states that the candidate worked at Inchcape Australia and then questions whether it is a Fortune 500 company.  The gold standard answer is that the resume does not mention this information.  The prediction introduces information not present in the resume.  While the uncertainty about Inchcape's Fortune 500 status is accurate, the assertion that the candidate worked there is unsupported and incorrect.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process to ensure that the system only returns information explicitly stated in the resume. Implement stricter checks to prevent the system from making assertions based on incomplete or inferred information.  Consider adding a 'no information found' response option when no relevant data is retrieved.</p>
