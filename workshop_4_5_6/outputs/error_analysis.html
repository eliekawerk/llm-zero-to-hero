                <h3>Question: Does the candidate have any leadership or management experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> emma-roberts.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Not mentioned in the resume.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Based on the provided resume, Emma Roberts has experience working collaboratively with various teams, including frontend developers, product managers, and QA engineers.  However, there is no explicit mention of leadership or management roles.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The incorrect prediction states that Emma Roberts worked collaboratively with various teams. While this might be true, it is not evidence of leadership or management experience.  The answer should have mirrored the gold standard by stating that such experience was not mentioned.  The model incorrectly inferred leadership qualities from collaborative work, showcasing a weakness in nuanced interpretation.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to distinguish between collaborative work and leadership/management roles.  This might involve fine-tuning the model with more examples differentiating these concepts or employing a more sophisticated prompt that explicitly clarifies the desired level of experience.</p>

                <h3>Question: What industries has the candidate worked in?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> jane-smith.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the technology industry, specifically at Tech Innovators Inc., Innovative Solutions Ltd., and Web Solutions Co.  The exact nature of these companies' industries is not specified.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the following industries: technology (specifically software development)</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The prediction omits key information present in the gold standard. While it correctly identifies the technology industry, it fails to mention two of the three companies the candidate worked for (Innovative Solutions Ltd. and Web Solutions Co.) and it incorrectly adds the detail of "specifically software development", for which there is no evidence in the original text. This omission significantly diminishes the answer's completeness and accuracy.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process to ensure all relevant information about the candidate's work experience, including company names, is extracted and included in the response. Implement more robust methods for identifying and incorporating all relevant details from the source document(s).  Consider using techniques that identify and extract entities such as company names and then cross-referencing them with knowledge bases to ascertain their industry. This would then allow the system to provide a more thorough and accurate answer.</p>

                <h3>Question: List the programming languages mentioned in the resume.</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> john-doe.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, RESTful APIs, JSON, React.js, Redux, Vue.js, Vuex, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer includes several technologies that are not programming languages, such as RESTful APIs, JSON, React.js, Redux, Vue.js, Vuex, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and jQuery.  While some of these (React, Vue, etc.) use programming languages, they are frameworks and libraries, not languages themselves.  The inclusion of these items makes the answer inaccurate and misleading.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to distinguish between programming languages and related technologies. This might involve fine-tuning the model on a dataset that explicitly categorizes these concepts or employing techniques to constrain the response to only include items from a predefined list of programming languages.</p>

                <h3>Question: List the programming languages mentioned in the resume.</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> alex-thompson.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, JSON, XML</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Python, Java, JavaScript</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system failed to extract all the programming languages from the resume.  The prediction is partially correct, listing Python, Java, and JavaScript, but omits SQL, NoSQL, JSON, and XML, which are also mentioned in the gold standard answer. This omission significantly reduces the usefulness of the response for the user.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process to ensure all relevant information is extracted from the resume. This might involve using more sophisticated techniques for information extraction, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) specifically trained on programming languages. It is also essential to check the quality and completeness of the resume's content used for retrieval.  Consider increasing the context window size or using techniques to better handle long documents, and potentially employing reranking strategies to better surface relevant results.</p>

                <h3>Question: Does the candidate have any leadership or management experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> alex-thompson.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Not mentioned in the resume.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Based on the provided resume, Alex Thompson has experience collaborating with cross-functional teams, leading workshops and coding sessions as a coding mentor, and managing and optimizing database schemas. However, there is no explicit mention of formal leadership or management roles.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The prediction states that Alex Thompson has leadership and management experience based on activities such as leading workshops and managing database schemas.  While these activities demonstrate some leadership qualities, they do not constitute formal leadership or management roles. The gold standard answer correctly points out the absence of explicit mention of such roles in the resume. The prediction incorrectly infers leadership experience from related tasks, misinterpreting the information provided.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to differentiate between evidence of leadership qualities and actual formal leadership/management roles.  This might involve fine-tuning the model on examples that clearly distinguish between these two categories, or incorporating stricter constraints on the generation to ensure it only extracts explicit mentions of formal roles when responding to the question. The system should be trained to avoid inferring information and to only state what is explicitly mentioned or not mentioned in the text.</p>

                <h3>Question: List the programming languages mentioned in the resume.</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> JO Reyes CV April 2025.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Python, SQL, TypeScript, .Net Core,  ReactJS,  NextJS,  Java</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SQL</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system failed to identify several programming languages mentioned in the resume.  The predicted answer only included Python and SQL, which are present in the gold standard, but omitted TypeScript, .Net Core, ReactJS, NextJS, and Java. This omission represents a significant portion of the relevant information.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process by exploring several strategies: 1. Enhance the resume's embedding. 2. Use a more robust keyword extraction technique. 3. Try different retrieval methods, such as dense passage retrieval (DPR) or BM25, which would potentially retrieve more relevant chunks of the resume. 4.  Increase the number of top-k retrieved documents to ensure that more relevant information is considered.</p>
