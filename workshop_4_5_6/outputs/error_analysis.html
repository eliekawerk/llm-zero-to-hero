                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> emma-roberts.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Over 1.5 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 1.5</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model's response, "1.5", is numerically correct but lacks the crucial qualifying information from the gold standard answer, "Over 1.5 years".  The omission of "Over" changes the meaning. While 1.5 years is part of the correct answer, the response is incomplete and does not convey the full intended meaning.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to identify and incorporate qualifying phrases and contextual modifiers.  Retraining the model with examples emphasizing the importance of preserving contextual information and avoiding over-reliance on exact numerical matches would likely be beneficial. The prompt might also benefit from explicit instructions to include qualifying information, such as "Always include qualifying words in the response when present in the source material."</p>

                <h3>Question: What industries has the candidate worked in?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> emma-roberts.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the technology industry, specifically at Tech Solutions Inc. and Innovative Platforms Ltd.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the following industries: Services, and Tech Solutions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer omits a key piece of information from the gold standard: the candidate's work at Innovative Platforms Ltd.  While it correctly identifies 'Tech Solutions', the exclusion of another significant role renders the answer incomplete and potentially misleading. The addition of 'Services' is also vague and lacks the specificity needed.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process to ensure all relevant information about the candidate's work history is extracted. This may involve refining the query, enhancing the document embedding process, or expanding the knowledge base to include a more comprehensive profile of the candidate.</p>

                <h3>Question: What projects or achievements are highlighted in the resume?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> emma-roberts.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The resume highlights the following projects: Cloud Management Platform, Data Integration Service, API Gateway, Monitoring and Alerting System, Cloud Resource Manager, API Management Platform, and Real-Time Monitoring System.  These projects involved technologies such as Python, Django, Flask, Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, Azure, GCP, Terraform, Docker, and more, and focused on areas like cloud management, data integration, API development, and real-time monitoring.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The resume highlights the following projects: Cloud Management Platform, Data Integration Service, API Gateway, Monitoring and Alerting System, Cloud Resource Manager, API Management Platform, and Real-Time Monitoring System.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer omits crucial details present in the gold standard answer.  While it correctly identifies the projects listed on the resume, it fails to mention the technologies used (Python, Django, Flask, Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, Azure, GCP, Terraform, Docker) and the specific areas of focus (cloud management, data integration, API development, and real-time monitoring). This omission significantly reduces the answer's completeness and value.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> context_window_limitation</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> The model's context window might be too small to process the entire resume and extract all the relevant information. Consider using techniques like document chunking and retrieval augmentation to provide the model with more context.  Alternatively, train or fine-tune the model on similar datasets that emphasize extracting both project names and their associated technologies and focus areas. This will improve the model's ability to provide more comprehensive answers.</p>

                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> jane-smith.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Over 7 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 7</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model incorrectly predicted "7" years of experience instead of "Over 7 years".  While numerically close, the omission of "Over" changes the meaning and is technically inaccurate.  The precision of the answer is not aligned with the question.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to handle nuanced language and interpret qualifiers such as "over." This might involve training on more examples that contain such qualifiers and focusing on the model's ability to capture the overall meaning and context of the question and answer instead of simply extracting numerical values.</p>

                <h3>Question: What industries has the candidate worked in?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> jane-smith.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the technology industry, specifically at Tech Innovators Inc., Innovative Solutions Ltd., and Web Solutions Co.  The exact nature of these companies' industries is not specified.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Based on the provided text, the candidate has worked in the following industries: Tech (Tech Innovators Inc., CodeMentor), and Web Development (Innovative Solutions Ltd., Web Solutions Co.).</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The incorrect prediction introduces the company "CodeMentor" and categorizes the industries as "Tech" and "Web Development."  While "CodeMentor" might be related to technology, it wasn't mentioned in the original text, making it a hallucination.  The categorization into specific industries like "Tech" and "Web Development" is an oversimplification; the original text only indicates that these companies are within the broader technology sector. The implication that all mentioned companies operate exclusively in tech or web development isn't supported by the original text.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to avoid over-generalization.  The model should stick closer to the information explicitly provided and avoid making assumptions or inferences about the exact nature of the companies' industries based on limited data.  A more appropriate response would acknowledge the limitation of information within the source text, reiterating the original text's conclusion that the nature of the companies is not specified.</p>

                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> john-doe.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, jQuery</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer includes 'React', 'Vue.js', and 'jQuery', which were not mentioned in the resume.  While these are related technologies, their inclusion constitutes a factual inaccuracy. The core languages listed are correct.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to distinguish between mentioned and related technologies.  Potentially, implement stricter filtering or verification mechanisms to ensure the generated response only includes explicitly stated information from the resume.  Fine-tuning the model on datasets that emphasize precise information extraction from resumes could also be beneficial.</p>

                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> 2.5 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 1.5</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model predicted 1.5 years of professional experience when the gold standard answer is 2.5 years. This represents a significant numerical discrepancy, suggesting a problem with information extraction or calculation.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to accurately extract and reason about numerical information from the context. This might involve refining the prompt, enhancing the numerical reasoning capabilities of the LLM, or incorporating a dedicated numerical fact-checking module in the pipeline.</p>

                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the technology industry, specifically at Tech Innovations Ltd. and Innovative Solutions Inc.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the following industries: 

*   Technology (Tech Innovations Ltd.,  developing and maintaining server-side logic for web applications)
*   E-commerce (developing a comprehensive API for an e-commerce platform)
*   Data processing (designing and implementing a data processing pipeline using Python and AWS Lambda)
*   Customer Relationship Management (CRM) (assisted in the development of a CRM system)
*   Inventory Management (contributed to the creation of an inventory management system)</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system hallucinated additional work experiences for the candidate that are not supported by the source documents. While the candidate did work in technology, the involvement in e-commerce, data processing, CRM, and inventory management is fabricated.  This is a significant error as it misrepresents the candidate's professional experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to constrain its generation to only the information present in the retrieved context. Implement stricter verification mechanisms to ensure the generated response accurately reflects the retrieved information.  Consider using techniques like knowledge graph verification or external knowledge base lookups to cross-reference generated facts before providing them in the final answer. Retrain the model with a more focused dataset and incorporate techniques to penalize hallucinatory behavior.</p>

                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> 12</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system extracted the numerical value "12" but failed to include the qualifier "Over", resulting in an imprecise answer. While the answer isn't entirely wrong, it lacks the nuance and precision of the gold standard answer, which conveys a range of experience rather than a precise number.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the LLM's ability to handle nuanced information and qualifiers. This might involve techniques such as fine-tuning on datasets emphasizing the importance of context and qualifiers in answering questions about numerical ranges.  Furthermore, ensuring the retrieval component retrieves all relevant parts of a document (in this case the 'Over') is important.  Output verification steps could be implemented to check for and correct missing qualifiers, potentially through a rule-based system or an additional LLM pass for verification.</p>

                <h3>Question: List the programming languages mentioned in the resume.</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> JO Reyes CV April 2025.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Python, SQL, TypeScript, .Net Core,  ReactJS,  NextJS,  Java</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Python, TypeScript</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The RAG system failed to extract all the programming languages listed in the resume.  It correctly identified Python and TypeScript, but omitted SQL, .Net Core, ReactJS, NextJS, and Java. This omission is significant as it provides an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of the candidate's skills.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process by refining the query or employing more sophisticated retrieval techniques like dense passage retrieval or reranking.  Ensure that the entire resume is properly processed and indexed, without losing relevant information during chunking. Check for potential biases in the embedding space that might prevent certain terms (like '.Net Core') from being properly associated with the query.</p>

                <h3>Question: What industries has the candidate worked in?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> JO Reyes CV April 2025.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the following industries: digital twins, industrial automation, e-commerce, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), strata management, mining, and automotive distribution and retail.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the following industries: mergers and acquisitions (M&A), sales (via an internal project at Cevo Australia assisting the sales team), strata management, timber manufacturing, mining, and automotive distribution and retail.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer incorrectly replaced 'digital twins' and 'industrial automation' with 'sales (via an internal project at Cevo Australia assisting the sales team)' and 'timber manufacturing'.  While the candidate may have had sales experience, those are not accurate industry classifications, and timber manufacturing is a completely inaccurate addition. The omission of two industries and the addition of an inaccurate one represent an incorrect mapping between the source and the output. </p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval process to ensure all relevant information is extracted accurately. This might involve employing more sophisticated keyword search methods, improving document embeddings to better capture semantic similarity, or using multiple retrieval sources to cross-reference the results.  Additional techniques could include expanding the search query to encompass broader synonyms and related terms, and refining any stop word lists employed.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h3>Question: Does the candidate have experience working with cloud technologies?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> JO Reyes CV April 2025.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Yes, the candidate has over a decade of cloud-native development experience, primarily on AWS, but also mentions experience with Azure.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Yes, the candidate has experience working with AWS, Azure, Modal, and Baseten cloud technologies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The model hallucinated additional cloud technologies (Modal and Baseten) that the candidate did not mention in their resume or any provided context. While the model correctly identified AWS and Azure experience, the inclusion of the fabricated technologies is a significant inaccuracy.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the model's ability to distinguish between factual information and generated content.  This might involve training on datasets that emphasize factual accuracy and penalize hallucination.  Additionally, refining the prompt engineering to specifically request only information explicitly mentioned in the provided source documents might mitigate this issue. Implementing stronger methods for verifying the generated answer against the source document is also recommended.</p>
