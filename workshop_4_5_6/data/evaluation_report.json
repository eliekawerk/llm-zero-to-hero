Minor differences exist such as the predicted answer specifying the Intelligent Document Processing project as a 'proof of concept', which is not explicitly stated in the gold standard, but the core information is present.  The mention of Cevo Australia instead of the company name in the gold standard is a minor discrepancy.  The overall meaning and key information are preserved. The percentage is set to 0.8 to reflect this high degree of semantic equivalence."

The addition of the dates (January 2023 - January 2024) for the Graduate Certificate is considered minor extra information and does not alter the core meaning or introduce any factual inaccuracies.  The minor addition of specific dates improves the completeness of the answer, rather than detracting from it. Therefore, the prediction is highly accurate."

While the predicted answer adds details about Modal and Baseten, and provides more specifics on project experience within AWS, this extra information doesn't contradict or detract from the core information in the gold standard.  The additional details enhance the answer without altering its correctness regarding the candidate's experience with AWS and Azure. The minor discrepancies do not significantly impact the overall accuracy, thus leading to a high percentage_correct score."
