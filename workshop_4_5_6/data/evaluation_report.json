Both answers correctly identify the candidate's BSc in Computer Science from the University of San Carlos, Philippines, and Graduate Certificate in Data Science from the University of New South Wales. The order of information is slightly different, but the meaning is preserved. There is no missing or incorrect information. Therefore, the predicted answer is considered highly accurate."
