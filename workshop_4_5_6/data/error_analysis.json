      "details": "The incorrect prediction states that Emma Roberts worked collaboratively with various teams. While this might be true, it is not evidence of leadership or management experience.  The answer should have mirrored the gold standard by stating that such experience was not mentioned.  The model incorrectly inferred leadership qualities from collaborative work, showcasing a weakness in nuanced interpretation.",

      "reasoning": "The predicted answer contradicts the gold standard. While it correctly states that leadership roles are not explicitly mentioned, it adds extra information about Emma Roberts' collaborative experience.  This extra information is not relevant to the gold standard, which only focuses on the absence of information. The prediction should have mirrored the gold standard more closely by simply stating that the requested information is not present in the resume. Therefore, it is only partially correct."

      "severity": "major",
      "details": "The prediction omits key information present in the gold standard. While it correctly identifies the technology industry, it fails to mention two of the three companies the candidate worked for (Innovative Solutions Ltd. and Web Solutions Co.) and it incorrectly adds the detail of \"specifically software development\", for which there is no evidence in the original text. This omission significantly diminishes the answer's completeness and accuracy.",

      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the retrieval process to ensure all relevant information about the candidate's work experience, including company names, is extracted and included in the response. Implement more robust methods for identifying and incorporating all relevant details from the source document(s).  Consider using techniques that identify and extract entities such as company names and then cross-referencing them with knowledge bases to ascertain their industry. This would then allow the system to provide a more thorough and accurate answer.",

      "reasoning": "The predicted answer is partially correct but omits crucial details present in the gold standard. While it correctly identifies that the candidate worked in the technology industry, it fails to mention the specific companies: Tech Innovators Inc., Innovative Solutions Ltd., and Web Solutions Co.  The prediction also incorrectly specifies \"specifically software development\", which is not supported by the gold standard.  The gold standard explicitly states that the exact nature of the companies' industries is unspecified, a detail missing from the prediction.  Therefore, a low percentage_correct reflects the significant omission of key information."

While some of these (React, Vue, etc.) use programming languages, they are frameworks and libraries, not languages themselves.  The inclusion of these items makes the answer inaccurate and misleading.",

However, it includes many additional technologies (RESTful APIs, JSON, React.js, Redux, Vue.js, Vuex, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery) that are not part of the gold standard. While the additional technologies might be relevant in a broader web development context, they are not directly requested by the gold standard.  The core technologies represent roughly 60% of the prediction, hence the percentage_correct is set to 0.6. Because this is below the threshold of 0.75 for is_correct, it's set to false."

This might involve using more sophisticated techniques for information extraction, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) specifically trained on programming languages. It is also essential to check the quality and completeness of the resume's content used for retrieval.  Consider increasing the context window size or using techniques to better handle long documents, and potentially employing reranking strategies to better surface relevant results.",

While these activities demonstrate some leadership qualities, they do not constitute formal leadership or management roles. The gold standard answer correctly points out the absence of explicit mention of such roles in the resume. The prediction incorrectly infers leadership experience from related tasks, misinterpreting the information provided.",

      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the LLM's ability to differentiate between evidence of leadership qualities and actual formal leadership/management roles.  This might involve fine-tuning the model on examples that clearly distinguish between these two categories, or incorporating stricter constraints on the generation to ensure it only extracts explicit mentions of formal roles when responding to the question. The system should be trained to avoid inferring information and to only state what is explicitly mentioned or not mentioned in the text.",

However, there is no explicit mention of formal leadership or management roles.",
      "is_correct": false,
      "percentage_correct": 0.25,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer provides a summary of Alex Thompson's resume, which is not what the gold standard answer is looking for. While the prediction correctly points out the lack of explicit mention of formal leadership roles, it doesn't directly state that the information is not mentioned in the resume like the gold standard.  The prediction also adds extra information about the candidate's skills and experiences. Therefore, although the prediction contains some correct information, it deviates significantly from the gold standard, which focuses solely on the absence of specific information."

While both Python and SQL are present in both, the predicted answer omits several key languages from the gold standard (TypeScript, .Net Core, ReactJS, NextJS, Java).  The addition of TensorFlow and PyTorch are not incorrect, but they are not part of the gold standard and therefore are not relevant to the evaluation. The percentage correct is calculated as 2/7, representing the two correct languages out of the seven in the gold standard."
