      "details": "The model's prediction of \"7\" is numerically incorrect, as the gold standard answer specifies \"Over 7 years\".  The model correctly identified a numerical answer relating to years of experience but failed to capture the nuance of \"over\" 7 years, losing precision.",
      "likely_cause": "llm_reasoning_error",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the model's ability to handle comparative phrases like \"over\" and \"more than.\" This could involve incorporating more sophisticated numerical reasoning capabilities and training on datasets with a diverse range of comparative expressions within numerical contexts.  Additionally, training examples should include instances emphasizing the importance of retaining qualifying words in the response.  During post-processing, add a check to see if the response is a number and the gold standard contains qualifiers (e.g., \"over\", \"approximately\", \"more than\", etc.). If so, output a warning indicating potential precision loss.",

      "percentage_correct": 0.25,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer '7' is partially correct but lacks crucial information present in the gold standard answer, 'Over 7 years'. While the number 7 is present in both, the gold standard specifies 'Over 7 years', indicating a duration exceeding 7 years.  The predicted answer misses the 'Over' qualifier, which changes the meaning and context. Therefore, only a fraction of the information is correctly extracted, resulting in a low percentage score."

      "severity": "major",
      "details": "The RAG system failed to retrieve and include all relevant information about the candidate's academic qualifications. While it correctly identified the Bachelor of Science degree, it omitted the additional certifications from Udacity and freeCodeCamp. This omission presents an incomplete picture of the candidate's qualifications.",
      "likely_cause": "retrieval_failure",

      "reasoning": "The predicted answer captures the main information about the candidate's Bachelor of Science degree, which is the most significant piece of information in the gold standard.  However, it omits the candidate's Udacity nanodegree and freeCodeCamp certification.  These represent additional qualifications and represent about 40% of the information in the gold standard. Therefore, the prediction is approximately 60% correct."

      "likely_cause": "retrieval_failure",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the retrieval mechanism to ensure all relevant information is extracted from the source documents.  Consider using more sophisticated embedding models or query strategies to ensure better matching and retrieval of the information related to professional experience.

      "percentage_correct": 0.25,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer (1.5 years) and the gold standard answer (2.5 years) differ significantly in their numerical values. While both answers provide a duration in years, the difference of one year represents a substantial discrepancy.  This suggests a lack of precision in the prediction and a deviation from the correct information. Therefore, a lower percentage of correctness is assigned."

      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the retrieval process to ensure all relevant information is extracted from the resume. This might involve refining the retrieval query, adjusting the ranking algorithm to prioritize more comprehensive matches, or using a more robust embedding model.  A more thorough post-processing check could also identify missing or incomplete lists.",

      "percentage_correct": 0.7,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer covers most of the key programming languages from the gold standard. However, it omits JSON and XML, which are important data formats.  Node.js is included, which is a JavaScript runtime environment, not a language in the same category as the others. Given the omissions, a 70% correctness score seems appropriate.  The threshold for is_correct is 50%, so it is set to false."

      "details": "The model incorrectly infers leadership and management experience from collaborative work and mentoring activities. While the description of Alex Thompson's roles mentions collaboration and mentoring, these do not constitute formal leadership or management experience, which typically involves direct reports and/or budgetary responsibilities.  The gold standard answer correctly identifies that the resume lacks mention of such experience. The model's answer is a misinterpretation of the provided context and introduces false information.",
      "likely_cause": "llm_reasoning_error",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the model's ability to distinguish between collaborative work and formal leadership/management roles.  This could involve fine-tuning the model on a dataset that explicitly contrasts these concepts, or incorporating stricter rules into the response generation process to ensure that claims of leadership/management are only made if explicitly supported by the provided text.  The model should be trained to accurately reflect the absence of information when it is not present in the source document.",

In their role as Backend Developer at Tech Innovations Ltd., they collaborated with frontend developers, product managers, and QA engineers to define requirements, establish timelines, and deliver features.  Additionally, they conducted code reviews and provided feedback to ensure code quality.  As a Coding Mentor at Code4Good, they mentored aspiring backend developers, conducted workshops, and assisted in organizing hackathons.  However, the resume doesn't describe formal leadership or management roles with direct reports or budgetary responsibilities.",
      "is_correct": false,
      "percentage_correct": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer contradicts the gold standard. While it acknowledges the absence of explicitly labeled leadership roles, it then proceeds to describe experiences that could be interpreted as leadership or management.  This is not semantically equivalent to \"Not mentioned in the resume.\"  The prediction provides details that are not supported by a claim of absence.  Therefore, a low percentage correct is assigned."

      "likely_cause": "llm_reasoning_error",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the model's ability to handle nuanced phrasing like \"Over 12 years.\" This might involve training on more diverse examples with similar phrasing, incorporating better numerical reasoning capabilities, or employing techniques to manage uncertainty and provide a range of possible answers instead of a single precise number when appropriate.  Furthermore, ensuring the retrieval system returns relevant and precise information about experience is crucial.  A post-processing step to verify the reasonableness of numerical answers against the source text can also help.",

      "percentage_correct": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer, \"17\", is numerically different from the gold standard, \"Over 12 years\". While \"17\" might refer to a period of time (perhaps 17 years), it lacks the necessary information of the gold standard indicating that the time period is 'over 12 years'.  Therefore, there is only partial semantic overlap. The key information about exceeding 12 years is missing. Based on the level of mismatch, a percentage_correct of 0.2 is assigned."

      "likely_cause": "retrieval_failure",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the retrieval component of the RAG system. This may involve techniques such as query expansion to enhance recall, optimization of the retrieval model to better match the question with relevant document sections containing programming language information, or using a different retrieval method entirely.

      "is_correct": false,
      "percentage_correct": 0.333,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer only contains three out of seven programming languages listed in the gold standard.

The missing languages are SQL, ReactJS, NextJS, and Java."

      "details": "The prediction states that the candidate worked at Inchcape Australia and then questions whether it is a Fortune 500 company.  The gold standard answer is that the resume does not mention this information.  The prediction introduces information not present in the resume.  While the uncertainty about Inchcape's Fortune 500 status is accurate, the assertion that the candidate worked there is unsupported and incorrect.",
      "likely_cause": "retrieval_failure",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the retrieval process to ensure that the system only returns information explicitly stated in the resume.

However, it also adds extra, irrelevant information about the candidate's work experience at Inchcape Australia. This additional information is not relevant to whether the information is mentioned in the resume, making the answer only partially correct and below the threshold for correctness (0.5)."
