      "details": "The model hallucinated leadership experience.  The gold standard answer explicitly states that leadership experience is not mentioned in the resume. The model's claim that Emma Roberts mentored aspiring developers implies leadership is a fabrication, as this detail is not supported by the provided context (resume).",
      "likely_cause": "llm_reasoning_error",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the model's ability to distinguish between implicit and explicit information.  Implement stronger fact-checking mechanisms to verify the model's claims against the source document.  Retrain the model on examples that emphasize the importance of precise and accurate information retrieval, and penalize hallucinated information.",

      "question": "Does the candidate have any leadership or management experience?",
      "gold_answer": "Not mentioned in the resume.",
      "predicted_answer": "Based on the provided resume, Emma Roberts has mentored aspiring platform developers as a Tech Mentor at Code5Good, implying some leadership experience.  However, there is no explicit mention of management responsibilities in her roles.",
      "is_correct": false,
      "percentage_correct": 0.25,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer acknowledges the absence of explicit management experience, aligning with the gold standard's statement that this information is 'Not mentioned in the resume'. However, the prediction adds details about Emma Robert's mentoring role, which is extra information not explicitly requested and dilutes the core message of the gold standard.  Therefore, while it partially addresses the gold standard, it does not fully capture the essence. The inclusion of the additional information about her mentoring experience lowers the percentage correct."

      "error_type": "incorrect_information",
      "severity": "minor",
      "details": "The model's response, \"1.5 years\", is technically incorrect because the gold standard answer specifies \"Over 1.5 years\".  While the numerical part is close, the response lacks the crucial qualifier \"Over\", thus misrepresenting the actual experience.",
      "likely_cause": "llm_reasoning_error",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the model's ability to identify and incorporate qualifying phrases like \"over\", \"under\", \"approximately\", etc. This could involve more robust training data encompassing various numerical qualifiers and improved prompt engineering to elicit precise information extraction.",

      "percentage_correct": 0.5,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer, \"1.5 years\", is close to the gold standard, \"Over 1.5 years\", but it lacks the \"Over\" qualifier.  This means it is partially correct, but not fully accurate.  The difference is significant enough to drop it below the 0.75 threshold for being marked as fully correct.  A prediction of \"More than 1.5 years\" would have scored higher."

While Google Cloud is a service, it's more accurately classified under the technology industry, aligning with the candidate's other experiences at Tech Solutions and Innovative Platforms. The core information is present but miscategorized, leading to a slightly inaccurate industry representation.",
      "likely_cause": "llm_reasoning_error",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the LLM's ability to classify industries more accurately.  This might involve training it on a richer dataset of industry classifications or incorporating a more sophisticated industry ontology during the response generation phase.  Additionally, providing more context on what constitutes \"technology industry\" could assist the LLM.",

      "is_correct": false,
      "percentage_correct": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer correctly identifies Tech Solutions and Innovative Platforms as companies where the candidate worked.  However, it introduces \"Services (Google Cloud)\" which is not mentioned in the gold standard and omits the explicit mention of the technology industry.  While the core information is partially correct, the inclusion of extra information and omission of key details lowers the percentage correct score."

      "details": "The prediction introduces an unsupported detail: \"specifically software development\" and a speculative detail: \"and potentially e-commerce (given the mention of developing an e-commerce platform)\".  While the resume may mention an e-commerce platform, this doesn't automatically mean the candidate worked in the e-commerce *industry*. The gold standard appropriately reflects the information available - the candidate worked in technology, but the specific sub-industry within technology is not specified.  The addition of \"software development\" is an unsupported assumption. ",
      "likely_cause": "llm_reasoning_error",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the LLM's ability to avoid making assumptions not explicitly supported by the retrieved context.  The model should be trained to prefer more conservative answers when the information is ambiguous and to clearly indicate when it is inferring or speculating instead of presenting inferences as facts.  Consider adding a prompt that instructs the LLM to only use explicitly mentioned information.",

      "percentage_correct": 0.25,
      "reasoning": "The predicted answer mentions \"software development\" and \"potentially e-commerce\", which are not explicitly stated in the gold standard. While the gold standard mentions work in the technology industry, it doesn't specify software development or e-commerce.  The prediction also omits the names of the three companies mentioned in the gold standard. Therefore, the overlap is limited, resulting in a low percentage correct."

While these frameworks often use the listed languages, they aren't programming languages themselves.  This indicates an issue with correctly distinguishing between programming languages and related technologies.",
      "likely_cause": "llm_reasoning_error",
      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the LLM's ability to differentiate between programming languages and related frameworks or libraries. This could involve fine-tuning the model on a dataset specifically designed to teach it this distinction, or by modifying the prompt to explicitly request only programming languages, and potentially adding examples of what constitutes a programming language vs a framework.",

However, it also includes additional frameworks (React, Vue.js, jQuery) which are not part of the gold standard. While these additions don't introduce incorrect information, they make the answer less precise and not fully equivalent to the gold standard.  A score of 0.6 reflects that approximately 60% of the prediction aligns with the gold standard."

      "fix_recommendation": "Improve the retrieval process by using more robust keyword matching and potentially employing semantic search techniques.  Ensure that all relevant documents containing information about the candidate's experience are included in the retrieval set.  Consider using multiple sources to corroborate experience claims.  Implement more rigorous verification methods within the RAG pipeline to cross-check numerical data against multiple sources.",

      "reasoning": "The predicted answer (1.5 years) and the gold standard answer (2.5 years) differ significantly in the duration mentioned. While both answers refer to a period of time in years, the discrepancy is substantial enough to lower the percentage correct.  The difference suggests a less than 50% correctness of prediction."

The predicted answer correctly identifies Python, Java, Javascript, SQL, and NoSQL.

This omission significantly alters the meaning. While the number is present, the lack of \"Over\" makes the prediction incomplete and less than 50% accurate."

However, it omits digital twins, industrial automation, and e-commerce, and it includes timber manufacturing, which is not present in the gold standard.  The omission of three key industries and the inclusion of one extra industry reduces the percentage correctness.
