## Demo Day Slides

Simply open the [index.html](./index.html) file in your browser to view the slides. It's built using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and can be customised as needed. The slides are designed to be responsive and should work well on most devices.

This is my slides for the demo day of the [Building LLM Applications for Data Scientists and Software Engineers](https://maven.com/hugo-stefan/building-llm-apps-ds-and-swe-from-first-principles) course. The slides cover distilled version of the LLM Evaluations learned in the course. 

To run, simply:

```bash
cd demo-day-slides
open index.html
```
