Token Efficiency Improvements:
- Overall token efficiency is low (0.4712 accuracy per 1K tokens)
  Consider optimizing prompts to reduce token usage while maintaining accuracy
- Most token-efficient question: 'Has the candidate worked in any Fortune 500 companies?'
  Efficiency: 0.6899 accuracy per 1K tokens
- Least token-efficient question: 'What projects or achievements are highlighted in the resume?'
  Efficiency: 0.3040 accuracy per 1K tokens
  Consider revising the retrieval or prompt approach for this question type

Cost Optimization Strategies:
- Input tokens account for a high percentage of token usage
  Consider:
  1. Reducing context size by improving chunk relevance
  2. Using more efficient chunking strategies
  3. Implementing a filtering step to remove less relevant chunks
- Most expensive question type: 'What projects or achievements are highlighted in the resume?'
  Average cost: $0.0222 per query
  Note: This question type also has relatively low accuracy (50.00%)
  Focus optimization efforts here for maximum cost-benefit impact

Performance Optimization Opportunities:
- Focus on improving: 'Does the candidate have any leadership or management experience?'
  Current accuracy: 50.00%

Potential Impact:
- Current cost per correct answer: $0.0226
- By improving accuracy to 86.00%, cost could reduce to $0.0189 per correct answer
- Potential savings: $0.0038 per correct answer (16.7% reduction)
