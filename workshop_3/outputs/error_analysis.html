                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Python, Java, JavaScript</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The programming languages mentioned in the resume are Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer includes SQL which is not present in the resume as per the gold standard answer. This suggests that the model generated information that was not supported by the source content.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Review the process by which the model generates answers based on context. Implement stricter verification steps to ensure that all parts of the answer match the retrieved content.</p>

                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> emma-roberts.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> 1.5 years</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> Emma Roberts has a total of over 1.5 years of professional experience in platform development.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer provides additional and potentially incorrect information ('Emma Roberts has a total of over 1.5 years of professional experience in platform development.') that was not present in the gold standard answer which simply states '1.5 years'. This suggests a likely addition or modification of details that do not adhere to the source information.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Ensure the model focuses strictly on extracting the exact numerical information needed without adding unverified or extra context. This might involve adjusting prompt instructions to emphasize the importance of factually correct and context-specific responses.</p>

                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> jane-smith.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The programming languages mentioned in the resume are:

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SQL</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer incorrectly included HTML5, CSS3, and SQL as programming languages, which do not fit the typical definition of programming languages. The gold standard answer, on the other hand, correctly limits the answer to traditional programming languages.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Refine the prompt or LLM training data to help the model distinguish between programming languages and other types of languages or technologies, such as markup languages and query languages.</p>

Additionally, it provides metrics like 'Increased user engagement by 25%' and 'Reduced deployment time by 40%' which are not present in the gold standard answer.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>

                <h3>Question: What is the candidate's most recent job title?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> john-doe.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Frontend Developer at XYZ Tech Solutions, January 2023 - Present.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> The candidate's most recent job title is Frontend Developer at XYZ Tech Solutions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer provides the job title and company name but omits the specific date range 'January 2023 - Present' that is included in the gold standard answer. This missing time frame results in an incomplete response.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> chunking_issue</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Ensure that the chunks fed into the model include complete and relevant sections of text, especially those containing date ranges or other temporal information that are often crucial to context.</p>

                <h3>Question: Does the candidate have any leadership or management experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> john-doe.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has led the frontend development of an e-commerce platform using React but has no explicit leadership or management positions mentioned in the resume.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> I don't have enough information to answer that based on the provided context.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer states a lack of sufficient information, failing to extract relevant management experience from the candidate's resume, which was present in the gold standard answer.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval mechanism to ensure that key phrases related to leadership and management experience are correctly identified and extracted from the candidate's resume data.</p>

            <div class="error-card major">

                <h3>Question: What industries has the candidate worked in?</h3>
                <p><strong>Resume:</strong> john-doe.pdf</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> The candidate has worked in the technology and digital agency industries, specifically in web development and digital projects.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> I don't have enough information to answer that based on the provided context.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The system was unable to retrieve and provide information about the candidate's work experience despite it being present in the reference data. The gold standard clearly lists industries like technology and digital agency, but the model responded with a lack of information.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Improve the retrieval component of the RAG system to ensure that relevant information is effectively retrieved from the data. This might involve enhancing the search query formulation or refining the indexing strategy to make sure pertinent data can be captured and used in the response.</p>

                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer includes an additional section on 'Volunteer Experience' which is not present in the gold standard answer. This introduces information that wasn't required or present in the resume, specifically about mentoring web developers and conducting workshops as a Web Development Mentor at CodeForGood.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> retrieval_failure</p>

                <p><strong>Gold Answer:</strong> Not mentioned in the resume.</p>
                <p><strong>Predicted Answer:</strong> I don't have enough information to answer that based on the provided context.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> The predicted answer suggests a lack of information in the provided context, implying that the retrieval or context did not contain enough details to affirmatively answer the question. However, the correct answer should have been based on the absence of information indicating work in Fortune 500 companies, as highlighted in the gold standard response.</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Cause:</strong> llm_reasoning_error</p>
                <p><strong>Fix Recommendation:</strong> Ensure that the LLM is better aligned to interpret 'not mentioned' scenarios as a valid and correct answer instead of attributing it to insufficient information.</p>
